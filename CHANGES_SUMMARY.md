# Changes Summary

## Overview
Updated the framework to reorder reusable utilities and enhance screenshot functionality to work on locked Windows screens with optional page parameters.

## Changes Made

### 1. Reordered Reusable Utilities

#### `/workspace/framework/__init__.py`
- **Changed**: Reordered imports to follow the pattern: Playwright → Data Providers → OCR → Date Functions
- **Added**: 
  - `BrowserManager` from playwright_wrapper
  - All data provider classes (ExcelProvider, JsonProvider, CsvProvider, TxtProvider, SqlServerProvider, SqliteProvider)
  - `ScreenshotUtils` utility class
- **Order**: PlaywrightActions, BrowserManager, Data Providers, OCRUtils, ImageUtils, ScreenshotUtils, DateUtils

#### `/workspace/framework/utils/__init__.py`
- **Changed**: Reordered utility imports to match the new structure
- **Added**: `ScreenshotUtils` to the utilities exports
- **Order**: CoordinateUtils, FileUtils, StringUtils, ScreenshotUtils, ImageUtils, OCRUtils, DateUtils

### 2. Added OS-Level Screenshot Capability

#### New File: `/workspace/framework/utils/screenshot_utils.py`
- **Purpose**: Provides OS-level screenshot functionality that works even on locked Windows screens
- **Technology**: Uses MSS (Multiple Screen Shot) library
- **Features**:
  - `take_screenshot()`: Main screenshot method with monitor and region support
  - `get_monitor_info()`: Returns information about all available monitors
  - `take_multi_monitor_screenshot()`: Captures all monitors
  - `take_primary_monitor_screenshot()`: Captures only the primary monitor
  - `take_region_screenshot()`: Captures a specific screen region

**Key Advantages**:
- Works on locked Windows screens (OS-level capture)
- No browser or Playwright page required
- Supports multi-monitor setups
- Supports region-based screenshots

### 3. Enhanced Playwright Screenshot Methods

#### `/workspace/framework/playwright_wrapper/playwright_actions.py`

**Updated Methods**:

1. **`take_screenshot()`**
   - **Added Parameters**:
     - `page: Optional[Page] = None` - Allows passing a different page object (defaults to self.page)
     - `use_os_screenshot: bool = False` - Enables OS-level screenshot mode
   - **Behavior**: Can now work with any page object or use OS-level screenshot

2. **`take_element_screenshot()`**
   - **Added Parameter**: `page: Optional[Page] = None` - Allows passing a different page object
   - **Behavior**: Can now work with any page object

3. **New Static Method: `take_os_screenshot()`**
   - **Purpose**: Static method that doesn't require a PlaywrightActions instance
   - **Parameters**: 
     - `path: Optional[str] = None`
     - `monitor: int = 0`
     - `region: Optional[tuple] = None`
   - **Use Case**: Take OS-level screenshots without any Playwright/browser dependency

### 4. Updated Dependencies

#### `/workspace/requirements.txt`
- **Added**: `mss==9.0.1` - For OS-level screenshots that work on locked Windows screens

## Usage Examples

### Taking OS-Level Screenshot (Works on Locked Screens)

```python
from framework.utils import ScreenshotUtils

# Take screenshot of all monitors
ScreenshotUtils.take_screenshot()

# Take screenshot of primary monitor
ScreenshotUtils.take_primary_monitor_screenshot("screenshot.png")

# Take screenshot of specific region
ScreenshotUtils.take_region_screenshot(0, 0, 1920, 1080, "region.png")

# Get monitor information
monitors = ScreenshotUtils.get_monitor_info()
```

### Using Playwright Screenshot with Optional Page

```python
from framework.playwright_wrapper import PlaywrightActions

# Initialize with default page
actions = PlaywrightActions(page)

# Take screenshot with default page
actions.take_screenshot("screenshot.png")

# Take screenshot with different page
actions.take_screenshot("screenshot.png", page=other_page)

# Take OS-level screenshot (no browser needed)
actions.take_screenshot("screenshot.png", use_os_screenshot=True)

# Static method - no instance required
PlaywrightActions.take_os_screenshot("screenshot.png")
```

### Using in BDD Steps

The existing step definitions will continue to work:
```gherkin
When I take a screenshot
When I take a screenshot named "login_page"
When I take a screenshot of "#element" named "button"
```

## Benefits

1. **Locked Screen Support**: Screenshots can now be captured even when Windows is locked
2. **Flexibility**: Page parameter is now optional, allowing screenshot methods to work with any page object
3. **No Browser Dependency**: OS-level screenshots don't require Playwright or browser
4. **Better Organization**: Clear import order makes the framework structure more intuitive
5. **Multi-Monitor Support**: Enhanced support for multi-monitor setups

## Breaking Changes

None. All existing functionality is preserved with backward compatibility.

## Installation

To use the new OS-level screenshot functionality, install/update dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This will install the `mss==9.0.1` package required for OS-level screenshots.
